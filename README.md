# Curve Of Remembering
This program is a planner that helps users by letting them know how much of the information they most likely have forgotten so that they can most efficiently manage their time and priorities. This program utilizes the Ebbinghaus Curve for Memory Retention.

The dashboard shows all the different tasks the user added. The number beside each task, representing the percent of information you likely remember from that "task", will decrease on a logarithmic regression. To view current percentage of information, click the refresh button on the bottom left corner. To add a task, simply click the "plus" button on the bottom right corner of the screen. Type in your task name, and the system will automatically start calculating for you. 

Clicking on each task will bring forth the specifications menu. In this menu, you can view detailed statistics and perform various actions. Clicking on the arrow button will revert the screen back to the dashboard. Clicking the trash icon will delete the task. To review material, simply click the check button. This will reset the memory retention, and the decrease will be less significant (as per Ebbinghaus' Study, Chapter 7).
