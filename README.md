# Curve Of Remembering
This program is a planner that helps users by letting them know how much of the information they most likely have forgotten about a topic/assignment over time so that they can most efficiently manage their time and priorities. This program utilizes the Ebbinghaus Curve for Memory Retention, or the "Curve of Forgetting."

The dashboard shows all the different topics the user has added to review. The number beside each topic, representing the estimated percent of information you remember from that topic, will decrease on a logarithmic regression. To update all numbers to their current percentage of information, click the refresh button on the bottom left corner. To add a topic for the first time, simply click the "plus" button on the bottom right corner of the screen. Type in your topic name, and the system will automatically start calculating for you. 

Clicking on each individual topic will bring forth the specifications menu. In this menu, you can view detailed statistics and perform various actions. Clicking on the arrow button will revert the screen back to the dashboard. Clicking the trash icon will delete the topic. After reviewing a topic, simply click the check button. This will reset the memory retention curve, and the decrease in forgotten information will be more gradual (as per Ebbinghaus' Study, Chapter 7).
